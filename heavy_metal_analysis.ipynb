      "                \"content\": \"Iron Maiden, released on April 14, 1980, is the debut album by the British rock band Iron Maiden. It was released by EMI in the UK, reaching number 4 in the UK album charts. The album was released a few months later in the U.S. originally on Harvest/Capitol Records and subsequently Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records and included the song \\\"Sanctuary\\\", which had been released in the UK only as a single, added to the track listing. In 1998, just like all other pre-X Factor albums, the album was re-released, and \\\"Sanctuary\\\" was added in all territories.\\nOf all the songs in this album, \\\"Phantom of the Opera,\\\" \\\"Running Free,\\\" \\\"Sanctuary\\\" and \\\"Iron Maiden\\\" remain on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours, with the latter used to introduce a giant representation of the band's mascot Eddie from the back of the stage.\\nFour songs from the album: \\\"Prowler\\\", \\\"Remember Tomorrow\\\", \\\"Running Free\\\" and \\\"Iron Maiden\\\" were covered for the 2008 tribute album Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine.\\nEvery song on this album except 'Strange World' has since been recorded by the Dickinson-fronted line-up of the band, either on live albums, on studio B-Sides, or both.\\n\\nThis was the only album produced by Will Malone, who lacked interest in the project and allowed the band to produce most of the album themselves. The band (especially Steve Harris) criticised the quality of the production, but many fans like the raw, almost punk-like sound to the songs. This was also the only studio album for guitarist Dennis Stratton, who left a short time after the album was released. He was replaced by Adrian Smith. \\\"Transylvania\\\" is a well known instrumental piece by the band which was composed by founder and bassist Steve Harris. The song was covered by Iced Earth on the album Horror Show. \\\"Strange World\\\" tells of a dystopian society, where people never grow old. Amongst other things the narrator (singer) laments how \\\"smiling faces  ever so rare\\\". Meanwhile, \\\"Charlotte the Harlot\\\" is the first of four Iron Maiden songs which make reference to the fictional prostitute 'Charlotte'. The 7-minute epic \\\"Phantom of the Opera\\\" remains a fan favourite, and is still performed at many Maiden concerts, while live performances of \\\"Iron Maiden\\\" often signal the entrance of band mascot Eddie onto the stage.\\n\\\"Running Free\\\" was released as a single on February 23rd, 1980, and reached number 34 in the UK singles chart. The band also performed the song entirely live on the UK TV show Top Of The Pops. The usual tradition was for artists to lip-synch, and Maiden were the first band to perform their song without lip-synching on the show since The Who in 1972.\\nThe \\\"Sanctuary\\\" single was released on June 7th, and charted at number 29. Manager Rod Smallwood's management company was named after the song.\\nThe 1998 re-release has, besides the addition of the previously mentioned song \\\"Sanctuary\\\", a different cover than the original release. The picture is the same, except that it's redrawn. However, on recent advertising-posters and the Iron Maiden website, the original cover is once again shown.\\nMetal For Muthas Tour and Europe 80 was the tour supporting the album Iron Maiden.\\n\\n <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Iron+Maiden\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"Killers is the second album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on February 2, 1981 in the UK, and June, 1981 in the US. The album was the first of their albums to feature guitarist Adrian Smith, and the last to feature vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was fired from the band mid-tour due to problems with alcohol and cocaine. This was also the first album produced by veteran producer Martin Birch who went on to produce their next eight albums before retiring after Fear of the Dark in 1992.\\nBeing the most popular song on the album, \\\"Wrathchild\\\" has been on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours. The song was covered in 2005 by the female tribute The Iron Maidens on their 2007 album Route 666 and again in 2008 by Gallows on the tribute CD Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine.\\nThe song was also featured in the Playstation 2 game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks The 80s.\\n\\nThe album is an unusual one in that it features two instrumentals and was written almost exclusively by Steve Harris with only minor assistance from the rest of the band. Only the title track and \\\"Twilight Zone\\\" received additional writing credits. All of the songs, with the exception of \\\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\\" and \\\"Prodigal Son,\\\" were written before the release of their debut album (they could not fit all of them on one album, and the songs were later re-recorded anyway to feature Adrian Smith); an early version of \\\"Wrathchild\\\" was featured on the Metal for Muthas compilation.\\nThe U.S. edition, which came out a few months after its UK release, was initially released on Harvest Records/Capitol Records and subsequently on Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records. \\\"Twilight Zone\\\" was also added to the album.\\nThe song \\\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\\" is based on the story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe. \\\"Rue Morgue\\\" is the name of a fictitious street in Paris, it translates in English as \\\"Mortuary Street\\\". However, the only reference to the story in the song is when two girls are found dead.\\nKillers World Tour was the tour supporting the album. This tour would feature the band's first ever concert in America. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Killers\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The album was released on March 29, 1982 through EMI. This was the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson in Iron Maiden. Number of the Beast has been cited as one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all-time, and is widely acknowledged as one of the best and most iconic albums of the genre.\\n\\nThe Number of the Beast also cemented Iron Maiden as one of \\\"the biggest metal bands on the planet\\\".\\n\\nOf all the songs in the album, \\\"The Number of the Beast\\\", \\\"Run to the Hills\\\" and \\\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\\" remain on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours, with the latter two often used to close a show. All three songs have been released as singles in various forms.\\n\\nThe Beast on the Road was the tour supporting the album.\\n\\n\\n History\\nThe Number of the Beast marked Bruce Dickinson's debut with the band. Though the recording process was successful, it was plagued with bizarre events - during the making of the album, record producer Martin Birch had been in an accident and crashed his car into one driven by a \\\"religious nutter\\\" on a rainy Sunday evening. When he got his car back from the mechanic the bill came back in the exact amount of \\u00a3666.66. Birch, \\\"terrified\\\", demanded the bill be rounded up to \\u00a3667. Also, the title track reached number 18 in the UK charts - the sum of three sixes. Other stories about various strange occurrences at the recording studio have circulated, such as equipment randomly breaking down and lights turning off and on by themselves.\\n\\nSince this album (and its tour, Beast on the Road), \\\"The Beast\\\" has become something of a nickname for the band and possibly Eddie, as suggested by albums such as Best of the Beast (which featured a 'best of Eddie' mural on the cover), Beast over Hammersmith, and the DVD Visions of the Beast.\\n\\nThis album is the only one to feature songwriting by drummer Clive Burr. This is one of several reasons why the album was so different from previous ones other than the obvious change in lead singer. It was the first album with writing by Adrian Smith (see below track listing for details), and the first to feature writing by the 'new' Steve Harris (his older style had been written for different musicians, and in a different time) - the entire writing system was different. However, it is one of the few albums not to feature a Dave Murray song, and the first album not to feature an instrumental.\\n\\n\\nReception\\nIt was widely panned by mainstream media upon its release, including Rolling Stone, who claimed that it \\\"blusters along aimlessly, proving again that bad music is hell.\\\"\\n\\nIt was also panned by social conservatives, especially in America. Due to its title, Iron Maiden was called a \\\"Satanic band\\\" in the US. Their Beast on the Road tour was marred by boycotts and protests.\\n\\nHowever, as time passed by, The Number of the Beast became one of the most critically acclaimed metal albums of all time, and was more accepted after the band became more mainstream.\\n\\nAllmusic said: \\\"The Number of the Beast is quite simply one of the best heavy metal albums ever released.\\\"\\n\\nThe album was ranked number 17 on Guitar World's list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 100 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, and a year later the same magazine named it as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The BBC made a documentary of this album in their Classic Albums series.\\n\\nIGN named it the third greatest heavy metal album of all time.\\n\\nMetal-Rules.com named this the second greatest heavy metal album of all time.\\n\\nThe album is also a part of EMI's \\\"Albums That Shaped Rock History\\\" series.\\n\\n\\nAlbum artwork\\nThe album was also the centre of controversy, particularly in America, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Satan being controlled by Eddie. This cover art was originally intended for an earlier single, \\\"Purgatory\\\", but the band felt the cover was too high of caliber for just a single and a less complex image was used for the single instead. The title track, \\\"Number of the Beast\\\", was said not be a satanic song was actually instead inspired by bass player Steve Harris's nightmares about dabbling in Satanism. The album's cover art has been parodied several times - by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger Than the Devil, and on a T-shirt by underground New York Hip Hop Label Uncle Howie Records *Streetwear brand Diamond Supply Co. parodied the album cover for a shirt in their line. Nick Tershay, founder of Diamond is reported as having had to pay $50,000 due to the parody being too close to the original art work.\\n\\nThe original 1982 artwork includes a light blue sky in the background; this was a mistake by the printers of the album cover, and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998.\\n\\n\\n Lyrical themes\\nWhile the title track was thought by many to be an assumption Iron Maiden were Satanists, in fact the song was inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film Damien: Omen II late at night. While he was quite scared of the Satanic images he saw in his nightmare, he also felt them amusing, and after that, he obtained the idea for the song, and also for the title of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Children of the Damned\\\" is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned, which in turn were adapted from the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. On a recent \\\"Bruce Dickinson Rock Show\\\" on BBC Radio 6, Dickinson told Ronnie James Dio that Children of the Damned was inspired by \\\"Children of the Sea\\\".\\n\\n\\\"The Prisoner\\\" was inspired by the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. Rod Smallwood had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the dialogue for the song. According to witnesses the usually calm Smallwood was completely star struck during the conversation. McGoohan was reported to have said \\\"What did you say the name was? Iron Maiden? Do it.\\\" Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, \\\"Back in the Village\\\" from Powerslave.\\n\\n\\\"22 Acacia Avenue\\\" is the second song in the \\\"Charlotte the Harlot\\\" saga.\\n\\nThe title track opens with a spoken introduction which draws heavily from the King James Version of Revelation 13:18, and is apparently inspired by Tam o' Shanter by Robert Burns. Barry Clayton is the name of the actor who speaks those opening lines on the album.\\n\\n\\nClassic Albums\\n \\nThe cover for DVD, Classic Albums: The Number of the Beast.The making of the album was released as a video on December 4, 2001 through Eagle Visions, as part of the documentary series, Classic Albums.\\n\\n\\nThe video was directed by Tim Kirkby and featured cuts from the title track, \\\"Children of the Damned\\\", \\\"Run to the Hills\\\", and \\\"The Prisoner\\\". In addition, extended interviews and live footage of \\\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\\" \\u2014recorded during the band's performance at the Rock in Rio festval in 2001\\u2014 were included.\\n\\nThe video reached number 9 on the Norwegian DVD Charts, and was certifed Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\\n\\nIt was released in DVD, VHS and UMD formats, and featured subtitles in six different languages, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.\\n\\n Appearance in media\\nOn October 24, 2002, progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at La Mutualite in Paris, France. The performance was recorded and has been released through the band's YtseJam Records label.\\n\\n\\\"Run To The Hills\\\" was covered on the all-star tribute album Numbers From The Beast, featuring vocalist Robin McAuley, guitarists Michael Schenker and Pete Fletcher, bassist Tony Franklin, and drummer Brian Tichy. The version slightly varied from the original, in terms of guitars, when Schenker added small solos.\\n\\n\\\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\\" was covered by Machine Head on the Maiden Heaven: A Tribute To Iron Maiden tribute album released by Kerrang! magazine in 2008.\\n\\nThe album has also been used in several video games - \\\"Run To The Hills\\\" is featured on SSX On Tour as the opening theme, and a cover version is a track in Rock Band in which it is the only song on the disk listed as an 'Impossible' song for all the instruments. \\\"The Number Of The Beast\\\" is included as a master track in Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock while a cover version is downloadable for Rock Band. Incidentally, both Guitar Hero III and Rock Band spoofed \\\"22 Acacia Avenue\\\"; in Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock, the first venue is 22 Arcadia Avenue and Rock Band features a venue located at 22 Acadia Avenue.\\n\\n\\nTrack listing\\nOriginal track listing \\n# Title Writer(s) Length \\n1. \\\"Invaders\\\"   Steve Harris 3:24 \\n2. \\\"Children of the Damned\\\"   Harris 4:35 \\n3. \\\"The Prisoner\\\"   Adrian Smith, Harris 6:03 \\n4. \\\"22 Acacia Avenue\\\"   Smith, Harris 6:36 \\n5. \\\"The Number of the Beast\\\"   Harris 4:50 \\n6. \\\"Run to the Hills\\\"   Harris 3:54 \\n7. \\\"Gangland\\\"   Smith, Clive Burr 3:49 \\n8. \\\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\\"   Harris 7:11 \\n\\n1995 reissue bonus disc\\n# Title Writer(s) Length \\n1. \\\"Total Eclipse\\\"   Dave Murray, Harris, Burr 4:25 \\n2. \\\"Remember Tomorrow (live)\\\"   Di'Anno, Harris 5:29 \\n\\n The album was reissued in 1995 with bonus material, including the songs \\\"Total Eclipse\\\", which was not included on the original release, and a live version of \\\"Remember Tomorrow\\\", recorded in Italy on October 1981, during Dickinson's first performances with the band. \\n\\n Personnel\\nBruce Dickinson \\u2013 lead vocals \\nDave Murray \\u2013 guitar \\nAdrian Smith \\u2013 guitar, backing vocals \\nSteve Harris \\u2013 bass, backing vocals \\nClive Burr \\u2013 drums \\n Martin Birch \\u2013 producer, engineer \\nRod Smallwood \\u2013 manager \\nDerek Riggs \\u2013 illustration \\nRoss Halfin \\u2013 photography \\nDenis O'Regan \\u2013 photography \\n \\n\\n\\n Chart performance\\nThe Number of the Beast was released on March 29, 1982, and quickly became a commercial success around the world.

      "                \"content\": \"Piece of Mind is the fourth studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was originally released in 1983 (see 1983 in music) on EMI, and on Capitol in the US; it was reissued later on Sanctuary/Columbia Records. It was the first album to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who had recently left the Paris-based band Trust.\\n\\n\\\"The Trooper\\\" remains as one of the most popular songs in the band's history, and has been included in the set list of all of the band's concert tours since the album's release. During the Blaze Bayley era, it was used as the closing song for the lineup's tours.\\n\\nTwo songs were covered for the 2008 tribute album Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden; they were \\\"The Trooper\\\" and \\\"To Tame a Land\\\".\\n\\n \\nHistory\\nLyrically, the album reflected the group's interest in books and film. For example, \\\"To Tame a Land\\\" is based on Frank Herbert's novel Dune. \\\"The Trooper\\\" is inspired by Tennyson's Charge of the Light Brigade. \\\"Still Life\\\" is inspired by fantasy/horror writer Clark Ashton Smith's pre-World War II short story Genius Loci. Other inspirations include \\\"Where Eagles Dare\\\", a film, and a novel by Alistair MacLean; \\\"Quest for Fire\\\", based on the film by Jean-Jacques Annaud; the writer G. K. Chesterton who is quoted at the beginning of \\\"Revelations\\\". More exotic influences include Greek mythology, albeit slightly altered for \\\"Flight of Icarus\\\", and samurai legend Miyamoto Musashi (\\\"Sun and Steel\\\"). Aleister Crowley influenced a good piece of the remaining lyrics of \\\"Revelations,\\\" which was written by Dickinson.\\n\\nThis is the first Iron Maiden album that was not named after a song featured on the album itself (though the words \\\"peace of mind\\\" appear prominently in the album's sixth song, \\\"Still Life\\\"). In its earliest phase the album was named Food for Thought but was changed so it would suit the artwork more. The name of the last track was meant to be \\\"Dune,\\\" but Frank Herbert, who disliked heavy rock bands, denied permission to use his book's name and thus a new name had to be chosen.\\n\\nIncluded in the liner notes is a slightly altered version of a passage from the Book of Revelation. As printed in the liner notes, it reads:\\n\\n\\\"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more Death. Neither sorrow, nor crying. Neither shall there be any more brain; for the former things are passed away.\\\"\\n\\nThe actual text (from Chapter 21, Verse 4) is nearly identical, except that it says \\\"neither shall there be any more pain...\\\" . This change can be seen either as a reference to the album's name, or the removal of Eddie's brain on the cover, or to drummer Nicko McBrain's inception into the band for this album.\\n\\nWorld Piece Tour was the tour supporting the album.\\n\\nThe album ranked 21 on IGN's list of the top 25 metal albums.\\n\\n\\n Hidden message\\nAt the beginning of the sixth track, Still Life, the band included a hidden message which could only be understood by playing the album backwards. This was a joke and an intended swing back at the critics who had accused Maiden of being satanic. The backwards-message features Nicko McBrain mimicking Idi Amin (or rather mimicking John Bird mimicking Idi Amin) uttering the following phrase \\\"What ho said the t'ing with the three \\\"bonce\\\", do not meddle with things you don't understand...\\\", followed by a belch. The phrase itself is taken from the satirical album The Colleckerted  Broadcasts of Idi Amin by Bird and Alan Coren. \\\"What ho\\\" and \\\"What ho said the t'ing\\\" are phrases that also crop up regularly on McBrain's \\\"Listen With Nicko!\\\" tracks from the First Ten Years collection.\\n\\n\\n Track listing\\n\\\"Where Eagles Dare\\\" (Steve Harris) \\u2013 6:10 \\n\\\"Revelations\\\" (Bruce Dickinson) \\u2013 6:48 \\n\\\"Flight of Icarus\\\" (Dickinson, Adrian Smith) \\u2013 3:51 \\n\\\"Die With Your Boots On\\\" (Dickinson, Smith, Harris) \\u2013 5:28 \\n\\\"The Trooper\\\" (Harris) \\u2013 4:15 \\n\\\"Still Life\\\" (Dave Murray, Harris) \\u2013 4:53 \\n\\\"Quest for Fire\\\" (Harris) \\u2013 3:41 \\n\\\"Sun and Steel\\\" (Dickinson, Smith) \\u2013 3:26 \\n\\\"To Tame a Land\\\" (Harris) \\u2013 7:27 \\n\\n1995 reissue bonus CD\\n\\\"I Got the Fire\\\" (Montrose cover) \\n\\\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\\" (Jethro Tull cover) \\n Chart performance\\n\\n Album\\nYear Chart Position \\n1983 UK Albums Chart 3 \\nU.S. Pop Albums 14 \\nU.S. Billboard Hot 200 70 \\n\\n Singles\\nYear Single Chart Position Album \\n1983 \\\"Flight of Icarus\\\" UK Singles Chart 11 \\\"Piece of Mind\\\" \\nU.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks 8 \\n\\\"The Trooper\\\" UK Singles Chart 12 \\nU.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks 28 \\n1990 \\\"Flight of Icarus\\\" UK Singles Chart 7 \\\"The First Ten Years\\\" \\n2005 \\\"The Trooper\\\" (live) Canadian Singles Chart 5 \\\"Death on the Road\\\" \\nGreece 9 \\nSpain 1 \\nSweden 5 \\nSwitzerland 61 \\n\\n\\n Certifications\\nCountry Certification Sales/shipments Year \\nUS 1x Platinum 1,000,000+ 1986 \\nUK 1x Platinum 300,000+ 1995 \\nCanada 2x Platinum 200,000+ 2006 \\nGermany Gold 250,000+ 1996 \\nFinland Gold 25,000+ 1990 \\nSpain Gold 50,000+ 1983 \\n\\n\\n Personnel\\nBruce Dickinson \\u2013 vocals \\nDave Murray \\u2013 guitar \\nAdrian Smith \\u2013 guitar, backing vocals \\nSteve Harris \\u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals \\nNicko McBrain \\u2013 drums  <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Piece+of+Mind\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It contains a musical re-telling of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\\", which uses pieces of the original poem as lyrics, and is the longest song Iron Maiden have ever recorded at a length of 13 minutes and 38 seconds. The album is also notable amongst the band's albums as being the first album to feature the same lineup as the previous one.\\n\\n\\\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\\" and \\\"Aces High\\\" were released as singles, the former being a staple in nearly all of the band's concert tours.\\n\\nWorld Slavery Tour was the tour supporting the album. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Powerslave\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The studio follow-up to the hugely successful Powerslave/Live After Death pair, it was the first Iron Maiden album to feature guitar synthesizers. Bruce Dickinson's song material was refused in favour of the songs of guitarist Adrian Smith, who wrote the bulk of the songs identified with the album (including the singles \\\"Wasted Years\\\" and \\\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\\").\\n\\nWhile many of the songs from Somewhere in Time have all but disappeared (and some like, \\\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\\" being only played once) from the band's live shows over the years, \\\"Wasted Years\\\" and \\\"Heaven Can Wait\\\" have been consistent mainstays of the band's live setlist. Performances of \\\"Heaven Can Wait\\\" have featured a group of local fans and celebrities invited onstage to sing along during the song's middle section.\\n\\nThe album also marked a change for Iron Maiden, as it was their first album to introduce synth, although this style was expanded upon in their next album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. This is also their first studio album not to be released a year after their previous one. The band has never released a studio album a year after the previous again as of 2011. The band began to put more time into writing and recording their albums as well as touring for an extensive time after the release of Powerslave.\\n\\nThe 2008 tribute CD Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine features covers of two songs from this album: \\\"Wasted Years\\\" by Devildriver and \\\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\\" by Madina Lake.\\n\\nSomewhere On Tour was the tour supporting the album. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Somewhere+In+Time\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Almost all the album includes direct or indirect references to questions regarding to these concepts and poetically refers the answers.\\n\\nStylistically, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son develops the sounds first heard on Somewhere in Time (1986), and continues the band's lyrical exploration of topics related to mysticism, power, and the occult.\\n\\nThe album debuted at #1 in UK charts (The only since The Number of the Beast) as well as #12 in the U.S, while the singles \\\"Can I Play with Madness\\\", \\\"The Evil That Men Do\\\", \\\"The Clairvoyant (live)\\\" and \\\"Infinite Dreams (live)\\\" reached #3, #5, #6 and #6 positions, respectively. It is the last Iron Maiden album to go platinum in the USA.\\n\\nOf all the songs in the album, \\\"The Evil That Men Do\\\", \\\"The Clairvoyant\\\" and \\\"Can I Play with Madness\\\" sporadically appear on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours.\\n\\n7th Tour of a 7th Tour was the tour supporting the album. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Seventh+Son+of+a+Seventh+Son\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"No Prayer for the Dying is the eighth studio album by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It is the first album recorded following the departure of guitarist Adrian Smith who left the band during the pre-production phase of the album. Smith does have one co-writing credit on this album, for Hooks in You, the third installment of the ongoing story of Charlotte the Harlot. The album ushered in a change of vocal style for Bruce Dickinson from the operatic sound of the '80s to a raspier way of singing.\\n\\nNo Prayer for the Dying also produced Maiden's only number one single to date, Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter, originally written and recorded by Dickinson alone for the A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child movie soundtrack. The version that appears on No Prayer for the Dying was rerecorded by the band as a whole. Holy Smoke and Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter were released as singles, with the latter reaching the #1 position in the UK charts.\\n\\nAdrian Smith was replaced by Janick Gers who had assisted Dickinson in the recording of his first solo-album, Tattooed Millionaire, and had also worked with Fish and Ian Gillan, among others.\\n\\nNo Prayer for the Dying is the only Iron Maiden studio album to date without a song exceeding six minutes in length. The album was also the band's first for Epic Records in the US after the band left Capitol Records but remained with EMI for all territories outside the US. Despite promising initial U.S sales, the album did not sell as well as previous Iron Maiden albums, being the first not to turn Platinum in the U.S.\\n\\nFollowing Bruce Dickinson's departure from Iron Maiden in 1993, songs from No Prayer for the Dying have been largely ignored at live performances. Only Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter has survived in concerts since, but it was only included on a nightly basis in setlists from May-July 2003. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/No+Prayer+For+The+Dying\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"Fear of the Dark is the ninth studio album released by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It topped the UK albums chart. Released on 11 May 1992, it was the final studio album to feature Bruce Dickinson as lead vocalist who left the band following the album's support tour to pursue a solo career. He was succeeded by Blaze Bayley, formerly of Wolfsbane, for two studio albums until Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden for the 2000 release of Brave New World.\\n\\nHistory:\\nThe album cover of Fear of the Dark was the first Iron Maiden album cover not to be designed by artist Derek Riggs. In an interview with MTV, Bruce Dickinson said they had asked three different artists to design a cover, and they then picked the best one. Melvyn Grant's illustration was chosen over the one Riggs submitted. Melvyn Grant has since drawn two more album covers for Iron Maiden, and the cover for their single \\\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\\" makes him the second most-used artist for Eddie after Riggs.\\n\\nThe album's musical style showed some experimentation with \\\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\\", a speed metal song released as the album's first single, and \\\"Wasting Love\\\", the group's sole power ballad. The Gulf War track \\\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\\" was the band's most political song since \\\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\\". The album featured first time songwriting credits for Janick Gers and featured more keyboard work than the previous album.\\n\\nOnly two songs off of the album, the title track, and \\\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\\", would survive on tours past 1993. \\\"Fear of the Dark\\\" became a popular live track and was the only song played on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour not from the 1980s. \\\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\\" became a frequent addition on setlists during Blaze Bayley's tenure with Iron Maiden.\\n\\nBoth critics and fans saw the album as a stale offering from an increasingly tired band. Dickinson's committment to the band was in question and the inclusion of a ballad left veteran fans disillusioned. Much mocked was Harris' 'Weekend Warrior,' which was viewed as an outdated view on 80's football hooliganism. The line \\\"what you gonna do on Monday?\\\" came in for much abuse. Metal Hammer criticised the lyrics on such tracks as 'The Apparition' and 'The Fugitive', but said the guitar solos redeemed the otherwise mediocre songs.\\n\\n\\\"Be Quick or Be Dead,\\\" \\\"From Here to Eternity,\\\" \\\"Wasting Love,\\\" and a live version of the title track were released as singles.\\n\\nFear Of The Dark Tour was the tour supporting the album. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Fear+of+the+Dark\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"\\\"Virus\\\" is a single from Iron Maiden, released in 1996. It is the first single since 1980's \\\"Women in Uniform\\\" 'that does not appear on any official Iron Maiden studio album. It was, however, featured as a brand new track on the band's first ever career retrospective \\u2014 1996's double-disc The Best of the Beast. It is the only Iron Maiden song to be credited to both of the band's guitarists. It has yet to be performed in Iron Maiden concerts featuring Bruce Dickinson on vocals. Along with \\\"Sign of the Cross\\\" from The X Factor, and \\\"The Clansman\\\" from Virtual XI, Virus is widely considered one of the best Iron Maiden songs with Blaze Bayley as the frontman.\\n\\nIn order to celebrate the band's 21 years, the single was released in three different formats. The first format features the same B-sides as the Lord of the Flies single from 1996, which included covers from The Who and UFO. The second features songs from the 1979 compilation album Metal for Muthas, which marks the only studio recordings to feature former guitarist Tony Parsons. The third features two songs from Maiden's legendary 1978 demo recordings, The Soundhouse Tapes.\\n\\nOn the EP Slow Riot for New Zer\\u00f8 Kanada by Post-rock group Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the track \\\"Blaise Bailey Finnegan III\\\" features the eponymous vox pop performer reciting a poem made from the lyrics from \\\"Virus\\\", written by Blaze Bailey (no relation).\\n\\nThe intro riff was also re-used by Bristol-based trio Kosheen for their song I Want It All from their 2001 album Resist. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Virus\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"Virtual XI (pronounced: Virtual Eleven) is the 11th studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The album was released on March 23, 1998. It was the second and final Iron Maiden album recorded with vocalist Blaze Bayley. The album is slightly unusual in the Iron Maiden catalogue for its extensive keyboard use. For this album all the keyboard parts were performed by band founder/bassist Steve Harris whereas on previous albums the keyboard parts were handled by session musician Michael Kenney. The album also had a reduced songwriting input from Janick Gers compared to the previous Iron Maiden albums since he joined the band in 1990.\\n\\nThe album cover and tour tied in with two extra-musical events: The band played football games alongside their tour (the album title relates in part to the eleven players on a football team), and the Iron Maiden videogame Ed Hunter provided much of the album art.\\n\\nThis is the third album by Maiden that was not named after a song on the album (similarly to Piece of Mind and the previous album). The limited edition of the CD came with a lenticular cover.\\n\\nJust like the tour of The X Factor album, the tour for this album was cut short when Bayley suffered from an allergic reaction caused by certain elements used on the stage.\\n\\nAs of April 2009 Virtual XI had sold 84,987 copies in the United States and more than 1,050,000 worldwide according to Billboard. It is the poorest selling album of the band's career. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Virtual+XI\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"Dance of Death is Iron Maiden's 13th studio album, released first in Japan on September 2 and rest of the world on September 8, 2003.\\n\\nThis album marks the first participation in songwriting by Nicko McBrain, who co-wrote the song \\\"New Frontier\\\" and also is the first (and so far only) time that all members of the band get a songwriting credit. It is sometimes mistakenly said that Steve Harris performed all the keyboard parts on the album because no credit is given to usual collaborator Michael Kenney, but this is actually due to an oversight in the printing of the album booklet (no instrument credits are given to any of the full band members either). Interestingly, the band's usual message in every album (a variation on the line \\\"Up the Irons!\\\") is absent too.\\n\\nGive Me Ed... 'til I'm Dead Tour & Dance Of Death World Tour was the tour supporting the album. Dance of Death once again brought costumes to Maiden's stage show. During \\\"Dance of Death,\\\" Bruce Dickinson would wear theatrical masks and a cape while moving around the stage; at the end he would dress as the Grim Reaper for the final chorus. During the song \\\"Paschendale\\\", Dickinson would sometimes wear a traditional British Infantryman suit as worn during World War I and act out his death onstage during the song.\\n\\nThe title of the album refers to the, late-medieval allegory on the universality of death: no matter one's station in life, the dance of death unites all. This philosophy is more commonly known as Danse Macabre.\\n\\nThe computer-generated cover art for the album was provided by David Patchett, but he asked to be removed from the credits because he was not satisfied with the result. The version used was actually a prototype provided by Patchett, but the band decided to use it in its incomplete form. Upon close inspection, one can note several of what appear to be errors; the small infant/dwarf to the right appears to be suspended in midair with his/her ankle sunk into the side of the wolf. The other small person to the left is also standing on the toes of a man, and the woman directly to the right of Eddie (center) seems to have some disfiguring on the fold of her elbow. The woman to the right of the foreground also has a long, misshapen neck.\\n\\nWhen the cover art was first revealed on the Internet, many Iron Maiden fans believed that the band was playing a prank. It has been the cause of much controversy amongst fans and is generally quite disliked. Images of the album's cover briefly circulated as an Internet meme as it was ridiculed by many fans and casual observers alike. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Dance+Of+Death\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"A Matter of Life and Death is the 14th studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was released on 25 August 2006 in Italy and in Finland, 28 August worldwide, and 5 September 2006 in the United States, Canada and Japan. It is the first heavy metal album to debut at #4 in India, and made it to #2 in the Indian charts. It is also one of the few rock/metal albums to go platinum in India. It is the first album in Iron Maiden's almost 30 year career to enter the U.S. Billboard charts in the top 10, and has seen significant chart success in many other countries. \\n\\nWhile the album is not a concept album, war and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics throughout the album, as well as in the album's artwork. The title \\\"A Matter of Life and Death\\\" is also linked with the war theme, as it titles a 1946 movie whose primary character is a WWII Royal Air Force pilot.\\n\\nThe band, still consisting of the same lineup as their previous two studio albums (making it the second most stable lineup; see Powerslave), started to write the songs near the end of 2005 after their hugely successful appearances in the U.S. and Europe. By the end of the year, the songs were done and they started rehearsing at Sarm West Studios in London.\\n\\nAt 72 minutes, A Matter of Life and Death is the band's longest album to date (exceeding 1995's The X Factor by approximately one minute) and its average song length (7:12) also makes it the longest Iron Maiden album by song average.\\n\\nThis is the band's fourth studio album that is not named after a specific song on the album, following Piece of Mind, The X Factor and Virtual XI.\\n\\nThe album cover was created by Tim Bradstreet, an American artist, currently best known for his covers on the Punisher comics.\\n\\nDuring their North American, Japanese and European tours, they performed the entire album in full. They announced after the show at Earl's Court, London on December 23rd, 2006, that the album would never be played in its entirety again. A Matter Of Life And Death Tour was the tour supporting the album.\\n\\nThe first single to be released from the album was \\\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\\". It was released on 14 August 2006. On 10 August 2006, \\\"Different World\\\" was put on the official website for everyone to hear. The following day \\\"Brighter than a Thousand Suns\\\" was also put on the official site for public streaming.\\n\\n\\\"Different World\\\" was the second single released from the album. It has already been receiving airplay on many rock radio stations. The song also features an animated video, similar to that of \\\"Wildest Dreams\\\". <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/A+Matter+of+Life+and+Death\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "                \"content\": \"The Book of Souls is the sixteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 4 September 2015. It is the band's first studio double album, and also their longest to date, with a total length of 92 minutes. Its launch and supporting tour were delayed to allow vocalist Bruce Dickinson time to recover from the removal of a cancerous tumor in early 2015. It is also their first album to be released on Parlophone, since the end of their 30-year relationship with EMI Records.\\n\\nProduced by long-time Iron Maiden collaborator Kevin Shirley, The Book of Souls was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris from September to December 2014, which they had previously used for 2000's Brave New World. The band wrote and immediately recorded many tracks in the studio, resulting in a spontaneous live feel. The album's first release, \\\"Speed of Light,\\\" was issued as a music video on 14 August and simultaneously as a digital download and CD single exclusive to Best Buy. In addition to being their longest studio record, it also contains the band's longest song, \\\"Empire of the Clouds,\\\" at 18 minutes in length, which was also issued as a single for Record Store Day on 16 April 2016. While not a concept album, references to the soul and mortality are prominent, realized in the Maya-themed cover artwork, created by Mark Wilkinson.\\n\\nA critical and commercial success, The Book of Souls topped the album charts in 24 countries. It earned the band their fifth (first consecutive) UK No. 1, following 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, 1992's Fear of the Dark and 2010s The Final Frontier. In the US, it matched The Final Frontier's success on the Billboard 200, repeating the group's highest placement at no. 4. It also marks the longest gap between studio releases in the group's entire career; at five years, following The Final Frontier.\\n\\nBackground:\\nThe band's intention to record a sixteenth studio album was first revealed by vocalist Bruce Dickinson in September 2013, who expected a possible release in 2015. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley from September to December 2014, with the finishing touches added in early 2015. They had previously used the studios for 2000's Brave New World, with Dickinson stating, \\\"The studio holds special memories for all of us. We were delighted to discover the same magical vibe is still alive and very much kicking there!\\\" The band originally intended to release the record earlier in 2015, but it was pushed back to 4 September while Dickinson received treatment for a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nThe album's title, artwork, and track listing were revealed on 18 June 2015. Released by Parlophone, this is the band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI after Warner Music Group acquired both companies in 2013. In the US, Sanctuary Copyrights/BMG, following BMG\\u2019s purchase of Sanctuary Records in 2013, issued the album. On 14 August, the band issued a music video for the song \\\"Speed of Light,\\\" directed by Llexi Leon. In addition, the song was simultaneously made available as a digital download and was issued as a single-track CD via Best Buy in the US.\\n\\nThe Book of Souls is the band's first album since 1995's The X Factor to use their original logo on the cover. The artwork was created by Mark Wilkinson, whose previous works for Iron Maiden include Live at Donington (1998 remastered version) and Best of the 'B' Sides (2002 compilation), as well as \\\"The Wicker Man\\\" and \\\"Out of the Silent Planet\\\" singles covers. According to bassist Steve Harris, the cover art ties in with the title track, as the depiction of the band's mascot, Eddie, is based on the Maya civilization, who \\\"believe that souls live on .\\\" To check the accuracy of the artwork, the band hired Mayanist scholar Simon Martin, who also translated the song titles into hieroglyphs. According to Martin, although the civilization had no Book of Souls, \\\"the Mayans are very big on souls ... So as a title, it's appropriate to Mayan culture, but it's very much Iron Maiden's own thing.\\\" Although not a concept album, references to the soul appear throughout, as do ruminations on mortality in general, with Harris explaining \\\"as you get older, you start thinking about your own mortality and these things more.\\\"\\n\\nA supporting tour based on the album was delayed until early 2016 so that Dickinson could fully recuperate from his cancer treatment. The Book of Souls World Tour began in February with the band performing in 35 countries across North and South America, Asia, Australasia, Africa, and Europe.\\n\\nWriting and recording. The album features two songs written solely by vocalist Bruce Dickinson.\\nHarris states that many of the songs were written and immediately recorded in the studio, adding to the record's \\\"live feel.\\\" Guitarist Janick Gers explains that this involved abandoning their previous approach of spending several weeks writing and rehearsing, which meant that they \\\"went into the studio with only outlines and finished writing the songs in the studio - so we were actually learning them, rehearsing them, and putting them down all at once.\\\" According to guitarist Adrian Smith, the pressure this created was positive \\\"because it snaps you into action.\\\" Gers states that each member brought in approximately an hour of original music to the sessions, even though they \\\"might only want to use 15 minutes of it,\\\" the result being \\\"a really broad spectrum of musical ideas.\\\" As with all of their studio collaborations with Shirley, most of the album was recorded live with lots of first takes used for added spontaneity.\\n\\n\\\"Shadows of the Valley,\\\" \\\"Death or Glory,\\\" \\\"Speed of Light,\\\" and \\\"If Eternity Should Fail,\\\" were the first songs written for the album, the last of which, according to Dickinson, was originally written for a potential solo album and features the band's first collective use of drop D tuning. Smith states that \\\"Speed of Light\\\" and \\\"Death or Glory\\\" were two of a small minority of tracks completed prior to the recording sessions, and mark the first collaboration between Smith and Dickinson (without Harris) since both members rejoined Iron Maiden in 1999. With both tracks, Smith and Dickinson deliberately wrote shorter songs in an attempt to hark back to previous singles \\\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\\" (1984) and \\\"Can I Play with Madness\\\" (1988). According to Dickinson, \\\"Death or Glory\\\" is about First World War triplanes.\\n\\nUnlike the band's previous two albums, 2006's A Matter of Life and Death and 2010s The Final Frontier, Harris does not receive a writing credit for all of the record's songs. This is because Harris suffered two bereavements during the writing stage (\\\"an old school friend and a member of the family\\\") which affected his creative output. The result was a more collaborative effort, with all members except drummer Nicko McBrain receiving a writing credit. One of Harris' contributions, \\\"Tears of a Clown,\\\" which he co-wrote with Smith, is praised by Dickinson as his favorite track from The Book of Souls and is based on comedian Robin Williams' depression and suicide in 2014.\\n\\nThe release's final song, \\\"Empire of the Clouds,\\\" replaces \\\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\\" (from 1984's Powerslave) as the band's longest song at 18 minutes in duration. The track features Dickinson on piano for the first time and is based on the 1930 R101 airship crash. According to Smith, Dickinson spent most of the album's recording sessions alone writing the song in a \\\"soundproof glass box with his piano,\\\" which he completed with assistance from McBrain. Smith states that it was a challenge to record as Dickinson \\\"laid down the piano on his own\\\" and the band then \\\"played along to that\\\" while following Dickinson and Shirley's instructions. For Record Store Day 2016, \\\"Empire of the Clouds\\\" was issued as a single on 16 April. Along with opener \\\"If Eternity Should Fail,\\\" it marks the first Iron Maiden album since Powerslave which features two tracks written solely by Dickinson. For the first time since 1998's Virtual XI, the final track wasn't written or co-written by Steve Harris. The Book of Souls is also the second album in Iron Maiden's history (following 1986's Somewhere in Time) in which Harris has not written or co-written any of its released singles.\\n\\nAt 92 minutes in length, it is both the longest Iron Maiden studio album and their first double studio record. Dickinson comments \\\"we all agreed that each track was such an integral part of the whole body of work that if it needed to be a double album, then double it's going to be!\\\"\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nProfessional ratings\\nAggregate scores\\nSource    Rating\\nMetacritic    80/100\\nReview scores\\nSource    Rating\\nAllMusic    4/5 stars\\nBillboard    3.5/5 stars\\nClassic Rock    9/10\\nThe Guardian    4/5 stars\\nKerrang!    5/5\\nMetal Hammer    10/10\\nNME    8/10\\nQ    3/5 stars\\nRolling Stone    3.5/5 stars\\nUncut    7/10\\nThe album received generally favorable reviews and currently holds a score of 80/100 from 20 ratings on the aggregate site Metacritic. It was scored 9/10 by Classic Rock, who stated, \\\"it's hard to think of another band of this vintage that would be capable of sounding this vital and inspired.\\\" Kerrang! And Metal Hammer gave it full marks: the former labeling it \\\"an album of extraordinary vision\\\"; the latter \\\"a gargantuan emotional journey through some career-best performances that more than makes up for a five-year wait.\\\" Blabbermouth.net was also extremely positive, scoring it 9.5/10 and deeming it \\\"Iron Maiden's most comprehensive and confident work since Brave New World and for certain one of their finest achievements overall.\\\" Pop Matters awarded nine stars out of 10, praising the band for returning to \\\"the very top of their game in a way we haven't seen since 1988.\\\" AllMusic awarded it 4 out of five, stating, \\\"With repeated listening, it earns shelf space with their finest records.\\\" The Guardian also scored it 4 out of 5 and, despite criticizing the \\\"lumbering 'Shadows of the Valley',\\\" exclaimed, \\\"The Book of Souls is marked by an impressive rawness that scratches against the album\\u2019s more grandiloquent moments.\\\"\\n\\nRolling Stone and Billboard were more critical, rating it 3.5 stars out of five, the latter describing it as \\\"outsized\\\" but \\\"surprisingly engaging overall\\\". Paste rated it 7.9/10, saying \\\"it's an impressive piece of work, but it gets bogged down by the band\\u2019s own ambition,\\\" although still concluding that it is \\\"the best Maiden record from Dickinson's second act, and an impressive achievement,\\\" while Uncut awarded it 7 out of 10, stating that \\\"an epic, if somewhat ruminative tone dominates.\\\" Both Q and Record Collector gave the album a mixed score of 3 stars out of 5, the former criticizing its \\\"lengthy longueurs\\\" and concluding that it is \\\"not one of their best,\\\" while the latter asserted that \\\"too much of the album is made up of endless mid-tempo guitar chug\\\" and that it \\\"sounds much like any other Maiden album from their career-twilight period.\\\"\\n\\nThe closing, 18-minute \\\"Empire of the Clouds\\\" was the subject of particular praise, with PopMatters calling it a \\\"masterpiece\\\" and \\\"every bit as spellbinding as 1984's 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' \\\". AllMusic described it as \\\"a heavy metal suite, unlike anything in their catalog.\\\" Although Blabbermouth.net and NME did not agree that it matches \\\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\\" the former stated that it is \\\"worth every single minute as a cinematic-sounding encapsulation of the band's career,\\\" while the latter called it \\\"the pi\\u00e8ce-de-r\\u00e9sistance.\\\" It also received a positive response from Classic Rock, who deemed it a \\\"stunning piece of work,\\\" while Billboard labeled it \\\"a highlight.\\\" Sputnikmusic rated it \\\"a significant improvement\\\" on the closing tracks from the band's two previous studio records (\\\"The Legacy\\\" from 2006's A Matter of Life and Death and \\\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\\" from the 2010s The Final Frontier), calling it \\\"cerebral and evocative.\\\" The Guardian, however, argued that it is unlikely to appeal to enthusiasts of the band's older material, although they did say that \\\"said  might be mollified by Harris's 'The Red and the Black'.\\\" The Guardian complimented the 13-and-a-half-minute \\\"The Red and the Black\\\" for its \\\"genuine urgency and agility,\\\" while Pop Matters dubbed it \\\"as predictable as  songwriting gets,  this time around it's a delight to hear.\\\" In contrast, Paste was slightly critical of all three of the album's longer songs (also including the 10-minute title track), stating \\\"in the end, the proggressive-jam logjam causes these songs to lose some of their impacts, even after multiple listens,\\\" although they did commend \\\"The Red and the Black\\\" for having \\\"the pace and feel of Powerslave\\u2019s \\\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\\"\\n\\nAccolades:\\nThe Book of Souls received the Album of the Year award at the 2015 Classic Rock Roll of Honor Awards, collected the 2016 Metal Hammer Golden Gold Award for Best Album, and won in the Best International Album category at the 2016 Bandit Rock Awards. In addition, it was also listed among the best albums of the year by some publications.\\n\\nCommercial performance:\\nThe album was a commercial success, reaching the no. 1 spot in 24 countries in addition to 19 other territories, which no longer publish retail charts. It was their fifth record to top the UK albums chart with sales of over 60,000 units, out-selling their previous record, The Final Frontier, which sold 44,385 copies but reached the same chart position. In the US, the record charted at no. 4, their joint highest position on the Billboard 200 along with The Final Frontier, although The Book of Souls was again the better seller with 74,000 sales compared to 63,000. According to Billboard, this marks the band's best sales week in the US since the Nielsen SoundScan tracking system began operating in 1991. As of January 2016, The Final Frontier has sold more than 148,000 copies in the US. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/The+Book+of+Souls\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Senjutsu (Japanese: \\u6226\\u8853, loosely translated as \\\"tactics and strategy\\\") is the seventeenth studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 3 September 2021.\\n\\nSenjutsu is the band's first studio album in nearly six years, following The Book of Souls (2015), marking the longest gap between two Iron Maiden studio albums. This is also their second double album, and their first studio album since Powerslave (1984) to have no songwriting contributions from guitarist Dave Murray in any way, as well as the first since Virtual XI (1998) to feature multiple songs written by bassist Steve Harris alone.\\n\\nThe name of the album is rendered on the right side of the cover art by the actual vertical Japanese spelling of \\\"senjutsu\\\" (\\u6226\\u8853), and on the left side by a font reminiscent of Japanese characters.\\n\\nCritical reception:\\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album has an average score of 86 based on 14 reviews, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\". Wall of Sound scored the album 9/10, calling it an \\\"epic and triumphant return for the lads... better balanced ... with some interesting songwriting\\\".\\n\\nSenjutsu is one of Iron Maiden's most successful albums, chart-wise, to date peaking at number one in numerous countries such as Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, and marked their first album not to peak that position in the UK charts since A Matter of Life and Death (2006); it did, however, top the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts. The album also gave the band its highest chart position in the US at number three.\\n\\nArtwork:\\nThe album Senjutsu marks the second use of the band's original logotype (with the extended letters R, M and N) on a studio album cover since The X Factor (1995), the previous one being for The Book of Souls (2015). The album cover by Mark Wilkinson presents Eddie dressed up as a samurai and holding a katana.\\n\\nTracks:\\nCD 1\\n 01 -  Senjutsu (8:20)  (Smith/Harris) 02 -  Stratego (4:59)  (Gers/Harris)03 -  The Writing On The Wall (6:13)  (Smith/Dickinson) 04 -  Lost In A Lost World  (9:31)  (Harris)05-  Days Of Future Past  (4:03)  (Smith/Dickinson)06 -  The Time Machine  (7:09)  (Gers/Harris)\\nCD 2\\n 07 -  Darkest Hour  (7:20)  (Smith/Dickinson)08 -  Death Of The Celts (10:20) (Harris) 09 -  The Parchment (12:39)  (Harris)10 -  Hell On Earth  (11:19)  (Harris)\\n\\n <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Senjutsu\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
